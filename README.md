## Introduction
### Relationship between Born and visible cross section
Precise measurement of the inclusive cross section of an e+e- annihilation to hadrons is
the main goal of the experiments carried out with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 collider. 
This cross section is of interest in connection with the measurement of the fine structure constant 
and the problem of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The inclusive cross section of an e+e- 
annihilation to hadrons is considered as the sum of the cross sections for exclusive processes 
of e+e- annihilation into different hadronic states. In the experiments carried out with the CMD-3 
detector, the visible cross section <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large{\sigma_{\rm vis}}">
is measured, while the Born cross section <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large{\sigma_{\rm Born}}">
is of interest. The visible and Born cross sections are related by the following integral equation:

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large{\varepsilon(x, s)}"> is a detection efficiency that depends on 
center-of-mass energy <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large{\sqrt{s}}"> and the energy fraction carried
away by initial state radiation (ISR). Equation (1) were first obtained by E.A. Kuraev amd V.S. Fadin in the work [1].
